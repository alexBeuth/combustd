Combustd - A crossplatform toolkit for Ambx or compatible devices

This application has been created in order to make the Ambx product usable on platforms outside the scope of Ambx's target group. Most of the project has been set up to create applications outside the normal usage pattern. Go wild, let your idea's flow. Make that usb controlled build monitor, access the your lights from the web. Use the power of the web to create controllable lights to indicate visitors. Use it for system monitoring.
