To combust; the act or process of burning. Combustion is usually found together with high releases of light.

# The upside #
Sadly Ambx doesn't provide drivers for software on other platforms then Windows at the moment. Combustd seeks to create a platform for developers and hobbyists to create their own ambient experiences. A platform where you aren't limited by the platform of the supplier. Imagine a lighting experience on your mac, linux, bsd or even windows machine only by running a little helper application.

Combustd initially started as a single daemon running on many platforms, but already has grown to multiple applications because of it's many uses. We are building a framework with lots of examples and runnable applications for use for instance on your media center, your website or even your webenabled phone. That's right we are able to control the set over your local network or even make it reachable over the internet if you want to.

# The downside #
Because combustd is written in ruby and uses ruby-usb, you will need to compile libusb and ruby-usb on your machine. This might scare away the average user, but it also means that we are very flexable and the software basically runs on any platform where these two dependencies are met.

Ruby dependencies are now being removed, we are working on a c++ version of both the library and the sample applications. For the ruby version checkout the /branches/ folder.
